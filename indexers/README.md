# QueryApi Indexers used by components

Several components use QueryApi Indexers as a source of data, specifically the ActivityFeed Posts & 'Following' Posts.

These indexers can be modified at https://near.org/dataplatform.near/widget/QueryApi.App under the dataplatform.near account.

Each indexer has a .sql schema file and a .js file which contains the Indexer Function code.
